This replication of the Google search Page is the first project from the Web Dev 101 course from The Odin Project (TOP).

Links are dead, and the search function does not send text input anywhere. 

For reflective purposes, the main learning points for me have been:

1. Using padding and margin to positon inside a div seemed to click in my mind.
2. Using flexbox to position divs - although, I know I'm not really grasping the full range, here.  For example, I'm not utilizing the eleents on the page well from a responsive perspective. I need to look into to viewport based units, I think, alongside wrapping functionality, which would add more power to responsive skills, personally speaking.
3. I found myself thinking more about semantic HTML.
4. I feel more confident with box-shadows.
5. In my limited experience of coding, I've used Atom text editor, never VSC - but I found it very cool.  I'm a convert - live studio is great, and I like the autoclosing brackets etc.
6. Using width and height to layout divs has got better  - I was previously inclined to just scratch my head and wring my hands when things didn't line up or take on the required dimensions.
&. Using position:relative without and position: X on the parent element was a bit of a revelation for me - suddenly I can an element adjust relative to its original positon within a container, and still kepp it in the flow of the page.  I'll use this a lot.
7. I made a css class 'outline-style:solid" and applied to all divs when constucting the layout of the page. It was hugely helpful is working out container height, width, padding etc. Easy to remove when finished with a given section.
8. I found that I, inefficiently, needed to make individual inline styling on the figcaptions to get them to align with the figures.  I'd much rather figure out a more efficent, elegant way of handling this with just a couple of .classes on fig and figcaption.
9. It was fun working with GIT for the first time - forgot to commit to the github repository in the main, though - spending too much time in only the staging area.
10. Working with the terminal was fun, too. Not finding it easy to move files between directories, but navigation and creating files and directories was easy enough. Will practice.
